1,  Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.
3,"I got a surprise for you, Morty."
7,"We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty."
9,"  What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage."
11,"Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had-- I had to-- I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb."
13,"We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start."
15,"Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica."
17,"  When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam."
19,And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
21,"And so that's the surprise, Morty."
23,"I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...   You don't got... Y-you don't gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty."
25,"You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she-- she, she, she's all for you, Morty."
27,"You know what, Morty? You're right.  "
30,"Get off of me, Morty!  "
33,Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
35,"  We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here."
37,"You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive."
39,"Sure. Why not? I don't, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo--  "
53,"What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"
58,"Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later."
60,"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something--tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  "
100,"There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
102,"It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. buurp It's important. Come on, Morty."
104,"Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!"
106,"I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.  "
130,"There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go."
133,"It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty."
135,"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be--  "
136,"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!  "
137,"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!"
139,"  Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
141,"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.   It defies all logic, that thing."
143,"Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?  "
144,"You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?"
146,"That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school."
148,"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an buurp under- buurp underfoot figure.  "
149,"Just take these shoes, Morty. They're buurp special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
151,"You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!"
165,"  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
167,"Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?"
169,"Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.  "
172,"Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?"
174,"Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.   The stuff was all over the place, Morty."
176,"There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that buurp they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. buurp It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they-- they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left."
178,"It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty."
180,"There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid."
182,"When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty."
184,"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
186,"Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty"
188,"And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y- buurp you've got to put these seeds inside your butt."
190,"Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty."
206,"  I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?"
208,"That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-"
211,Why does he have to go over there?
213,What new- buurp what new machine?
215,"Run, Morty! Run!  "
221,Don't think about it!  
222,"Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.  "
225,"I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.  "
227,"They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!  "
231,"It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!  "
233,"Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!  "
238,"You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.  "
242,"Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?  "
243,You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
245,Takes one to know one.
247,What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
249,"A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun."
255,What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
257,I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
262,"Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
264,"The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!"
268,"Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
271,I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
274,"Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.  "
276,No idea what you're talking about.  
280,"Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
282,"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."
285,"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.   And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com."
304,"Morty, come on. I need your help tonight."
306,"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty."
310,"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
312,"All right, Ruffles What's his name?"
314,"Snuffles, shake."
316,Roll over.
318,Go to the bathroom.
322,"Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty."
325,"Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one."
328,"It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about."
330,"That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may-buurp-be make sense."
332,"You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time."
334,"Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it."
336,"Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me."
344,Uh-oh! Spoilers!
346,I'm a full season behind.
348,"It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty."
354,"All right, Morty, time to make our move."
361,Allahu buurp akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
363,"Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"
366,"Take cover, Morty!"
370,"Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. buurp I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty."
372,"Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!"
393,"Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!"
395,Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
399,"Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking."
403,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
407,"Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!"
411,"Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!"
414,"All right, let's go."
417,"Don't judge, Morty."
419,"Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch."
439,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here."
443,"Oh, my God. Put some clothes on for the love of God Summer! Put some - I'm gunna puke! I swear to God I'm gunna puke!"
447,"Time to go another dream deep, Morty!"
452,"Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?"
455,"Oh, here we go!"
458,Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
475,"Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!"
478,The little girl!
482,"Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty."
486,"Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!"
508,What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
510,"Oh, yeah."
517,"Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding."
519,"Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
521,Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
524,"Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
526,"Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move."
544,"Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
546,Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
555,"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?"
557,"You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is."
561,"You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip."
567,"As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with."
581,"Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?"
583,"Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
586,"Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer."
590,If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
592,"It's all over, Jerry."
597,"Ooh, great plan, Jerry."
608,"No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon."
610,"It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream."
612,"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
614,"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."
616,"Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these."
618,Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
620,"It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg."
639,"I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven."
641,"What do you know, Morty? What do you know?"
644,"Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.   "
664,"  Ho ho ho, everybody. "
667,"Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend. "
669,I check in on him once a year and give him a little buurp medical buurp evaluation. 
673,"Don't worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry.   Ruben and I'll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise. "
695,"Hi Joyce, Leonard.   Hello there. "
697,Morty! A moment of your time? 
700,"He's in bad shape, Morty. "
702,"Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin' here trying to save the guy's life!   I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin' on. "
704,In Ruben.   
706,"Ruben on the table, Morty!   Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse. "
711,He's busy. 
714,"Morty, can you hear me? Head North! "
717,"  Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance. "
719,"Welcome, Morty.   ...to Anatomy Park! "
721,"It's a little business venture I've been cookin' up on the side with Dr. Bloom.   An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead. "
723,"You got a problem with that last one, Morty? "
725,"Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby. "
727,"I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty. "
729,Proceed to the liver. 
736,"Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great. "
740,"No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco-- buurp --holism.   That is an animatronic werewolf. "
750,"Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin' on here? "
756,Watch it. 
823,"Just take a deep breath, Ruben. "
832,"Oh, great work, Morty.   I'll just cure it, and then-- "
834,"Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor-- "
836,"--and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty. "
838,"  It's a bunch of pirates runnin' around a-a-a- pancreas. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible-- "
841,"--please, you gotta treat yourself. "
860,"Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one. "
961,"Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something?   "
964,I'm trying to concentrate. 
967,"  Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry. "
970,"Relative... That's it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite!   Morty! Can you get to the left nipple? "
974,"Morty, I'm talkin' about Ruben's left nipple! "
1000,"I'm almost there, Morty! "
1032,Where's Dr. Bloom? 
1034,"Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing! "
1058,Too bad about Dr. Bloom.   He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park. 
1060,What about Pirates of the Pancreas...? 
1062,Booyah! Hold your breath! 
1066,"Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me.   Puffy vagina. "
1068,"C'mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving. "
1071,"Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin' around with their faces stuffed in computer screens.   Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this? "
1076,"Loud and clear, Annie. "
1080,Hey everybody. 
1083,"Yeah, talk to me. "
1087,"Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! bleep. bleep those people. bleep this whole thing, Ethan. "
1092,T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship. 
1094,"Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it? "
1096,"Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing. "
1098,"Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it! "
1102,"Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph--buurp--isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one. "
1104,"Whatever, quote-unquote ""Morty."" "
1116,  Interesting... 
1128,"  Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency. "
1131,He doesn't care. 
1133,"Take a shower with me, Morty. "
1135,"Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now.   Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty. "
1137,"Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship. "
1139,"It's all fake buurp Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of... crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here. "
1141,"Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity. "
1143,"I can't let you do that, Morty. "
1146,No! You give it to me! 
1148,"Morty, come on! Morty! "
1177,"Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs. "
1179,"Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash. "
1181,"Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty? "
1184,"Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before? "
1186,"You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No. "
1188,"Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention. "
1193,"Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay! "
1195,"We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got. "
1231,"Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.   Yo, deejay, drop that beat. "
1234,"Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, ""The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,"" for a crowd this tiny. "
1237,"Now that's more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" yeah!   "
1241,"Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!   Run, Morty! Before the system reboots! "
1249,"Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to...the edge. Here we go.   "
1251,"Come on, Morty. "
1257,"Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots. "
1259,"It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them.   Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips. "
1261,"Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.   Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha! "
1263,"Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella. "
1266,"Totes malotes, dawg. "
1268,"Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine. "
1292,"Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.   "
1297,Uhh... 
1299,"Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots! "
1302,RUN MORTY! 
1314,Jerry?! 
1316,What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on.   
1319,"Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers. "
1321,I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter. 
1323,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water. "
1325,"Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium. "
1327,"Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time! "
1329,"Oh, no. "
1334,You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches! 
1337,"All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now? "
1343,"Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity? "
1345,"Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right. "
1353,"Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up. "
1364,"Hey, Morty. "
1366,"Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now? "
1368,"Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty. "
1370,"You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty? "
1372,"I really appreciate you, Morty. "
1374,  You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?! 
1376,You little son of a bitch! 
1379,"I-I-I'm sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good... You're a good kid, Morty. "
1381,Y-you're a good... You're a good kid.   
1389,Run! 
1392,"Morty, do it! Hit the button now! "
1394,"  Morty, I already told you, it's not your family! They're clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already! "
1399,"Good work, Morty. "
1403,"  Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable! "
1405,"You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna. "
1407,"I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough. "
1410,"Whoa whoa whoa,   come on, Morty! D-D-Don't be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place! "
1412,"Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that's real easy to say from the sidekick position. But--But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is. "
1414,"Okay, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. "
1416,Every 10th. 
1419,Washing dishes? 
1422,Yeah just don't do it. 
1425,"Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family. "
1427,"Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this. "
1430,"You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. "
1433,The Meeseeks fulfills the request. 
1437,And then it stops existing. 
1440,"Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods. "
1463,"God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?  "
1465,Can't wait.  
1468,"Oh, my God, so embarrassing. "
1471,Yeah. Beginner's luck. 
1503,"All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next? "
1506,"Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss? "
1509,"Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word. "
1513,"Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out. "
1520,"Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun. "
1539,"Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that. "
1541,"How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-  "
1544,W-what the hell is he talking about? 
1548,"All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home? "
1550,"Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.  "
1553,"Oh, boy, Morty. "
1555,"What do you say, Morty? "
1576,"Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps. "
1581,"What are you looking at, mother-  "
1585,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words? "
1588,25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little? 
1593,"Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out. "
1595,"Uh, because it's lame? "
1597,Whatever.  
1649,"Read 'em and weep, fellas!   Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad.  "
1651,"We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire! "
1654,"Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh? "
1656,"Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.  "
1679,"Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.  "
1681,"Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style. "
1693,What the hell happened to this place? 
1695,"Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot. "
1698,"Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box. "
1700,"What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs!   Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody. "
1720,"""I should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me ,"""
1722,"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school, I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, His marriage is hanging from a thread,"
1724,"Jerry, it's your house -- whatever you say it is is how it is -- but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door, I barely have a reason to care, and even I noticed,"
1726,"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed, It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage, I did it, Your parents are gonna do it, Break the cycle, Morty, Rise above, Focus on science,  "
1729,"Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty, It's gonna be great,"
1731,"Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, It's beneath me, Hand me the screwdriver,"
1733,"  You're growing up fast, Morty, You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass, Listen, this is called oxytocin, I extracted it from a vole, Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a -- it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty, This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love, All right, Morty, I just got to combine it with some of your DNA,"
1735,"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs, This isn't ""Game of Thrones,"""
1737,"All right, Morty, Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever, Are you happy now, Morty?"
1739,"W-w-w-what am I, a hack? Go nuts, Morty, It's foolproof, Eh, unless she has the flu,"
1778,"Well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up, Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides,"
1780,"Well, she's my daughter, Summer, I outrank you, Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card,"
1784,"Not for the men they cheat on, no,"
1787,"I'm sorry, Summer, Your opinion means very little to me, How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much?"
1791,"Uh-oh,"
1801,"Morty, come on! We got to get you out of here, You're not gonna believe this because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake,   Come on, Morty, We got to get out of here, Come on,"
1809,"I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu -- you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty,"
1811,"What does it look like? T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus, It's gone airborne, Morty,"
1813,"It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax, I whipped up and antidote, It's based on praying-mantis DNA, You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty, I mean, they -- they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner, I mean, it's a whole ritual, It's really gruesome and totally opposite, There's no love at all, I-I-I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus, It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty, It'll all be over very shortly,"
1815,"Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having sex with you, These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically,"
1817,"Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty, A lot of people don't get that,"
1833,"Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread, I've really outdone myself,"
1835,"Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking, Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, DNA's a little more complicated than that, You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the trick, baby, It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur, Should add up to normal humanity,"
1861,"Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal,"
1863,"Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush, I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done, It's fixed, You know, we could -- we could just enjoy it for a little bit, I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is, I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's -- it's pretty neat, It's pretty interesting,"
1865,"W-what do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I-I-I-I-I-I-I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I-I-I bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty,"
1869,"Bet you're loving this, Morty, This must be the best day of your life, You get to be the mayor of I told you town,  "
1885,"Boy, Morty, I really Cronenberged the world up, didn't I? We got a whole planet of Cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty, A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though, That's a huge step in the right direction,"
1887,"Me irresponsible?! You -- all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted to be -- wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school, I mean, g-- w-w-w-w-w-- w-- are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty, Y-you're a -- you're -- you're -- you're just a little creepy... creep person,"
1889,"All right, all right, Morty, You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking, Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting,"
1892,"Come on, Morty, Luck had nothing to do with it, I'm great, That's the real reason, Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis-- defibulizer?"
1894,"All right, Morty, Thank you very much, We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... All right, Morty, here we are,"
1896,"Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty!"
1898,"Calm yourself, Morty,"
1900,"Morty, Calm down, Morty,"
1901,"You got to calm down, Morty,"
1903,"Shut up and listen to me! It's fine, Everything is fine, There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal, I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time, Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine, We're not skipping a beat, Morty, -Now, help me with these bodies,"
1905,"Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me -- I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up,"
1907,"What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it, It's not like we can do this every week, anyways, We get three or four more of these, tops, Now, pick up your dead self and come on, Haste makes waste, I-I-I don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome,"
1912,"Here we are, Cronenberg Morty -- a reality where everyone in the world got genetically Cronenberged, We'll fit right in, Cronenberg Morty, It'll be like we never even left Cronenberg world,"
1914,"Don't you worry about that sort of thing, Cronenberg Morty, Let's go make ourselves at home, huh? "
1915,"Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator,"
1917,"Well, does it defraculate?"
1919,"Then -- then -- then it's a broken defraculator,"
1921,"Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur, So, let's say 60 smidgens, I tell you what -- I'll do you a favor, I'll throw in a fart,"
1923,"Not here, Morty, We'll stop somewhere else, because, you know, there's always another pawn shop,"
1925,"Oh, it looks cool, huh? That's why you want it?"
1927,"Okay, 60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot,"
1930,"I don't know, What do you want from me? He thi-- he thou-- he thou-- he th-- he thought it looked cool, You know what I mean?"
1937,"Where's the sex robot, Morty?"
1939,"Strange -- that's usually the man's job, You know what I'm talking about, Morty? Wubba-lubba-dub-dub!   Come on, you rascal,"
1942,"All right, Uh-oh,"
1944,"Hmm, I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends, Genetic compiler, incubation chamber, Yep, This here's some kind of baby maker, and that there's half Morty, half buurp Who -- who knows wh-what? It's my bad, guys, I'll -- I'll take care of it,"
1948,"Hey, listen -- you guys quarantined the house when Summer brought olives back from Mexico, I mean, this thing could grow to the size of Delaware, I mean, it might eat brains and exhale space aids, We got to be careful,"
1950,Don't name it!
1952,"Oh, crap, He named it,"
1956,"Fine, I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating, Do not let that thing out of your sight, It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous,"
1958,"Yeah, Good one, Jerry, 2003 just called, It wants its easy target back,"
1966,"Well, I can't solve the problem my way, thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups, Gross, I might have just touched one of Morty's loads, But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr, on this robot's home world, which is... Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system Scoot, Summer,"
1968,"I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer,"
1970,"Oh, crap,"
1973,Still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener?
1975,"Yeah, no duh, Ugh!"
1977,"Great, Now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs,"
1989,"Thanks, dum-dum,  "
1990,"I said, ""Rhanks, dum-dum,"" Go get more, Summer, put your burka on!"
1992,"Look, I'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts, and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from carting you off, The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender,"
1994,"Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines, The resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age, and now they just fight with each other over fake bleep with sticks and rocks all day long,"
1996,"You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you hear-- do you li-- do you hear me, Summer?"
1999,"The plot thickens,"
2001,"Uh, you might want to cover your eyes, Summer,"
2004,"Summer, grab -- grab hold,"
2006,Aaaah!
2008,"Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class, Sound familiar?"
2010,"Oh, there -- there we go, Summer, Hey -- hey, brother, Hey, bro, Nice racket you got going on here, Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137, Don't mean you any harm, Coming in peace, It's all cool in the, uh -- ""Good in the neighborhood"" is what I was trying to come -- is what I meant, Oh, I get it -- the old behind-every-great-man Amazon twist,"
2017,"  Ugh! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho! Oh, boy, What's the opposite of ""Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs""? Am I right, ladies and gentlemen? Are you guys kidding me?"
2031,"Wait a minute, We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet,"
2038,"We don't have time for Mojitos,"
2040,"I don't care, Summer! This place is the worst! I want to go home!"
2042,"Yeah, You know what I have to say about that?"
2046,"  Whoo, boy! Who let the frogs out, huh?"
2048,"It's not dominated by us, okay? On Earth, men and women are equals,"
2051,"Whoa! Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?"
2071,"Because I got -- I got a big, you know, penis between my legs, What -- what -- what are you in for?"
2076,"Pfft! This is gonna be cake, No, Jackie!"
2078,"What, what, what -- a night on the couch?"
2080,"Ooh, gerp,"
2083,Holy shit! Y-y-you're gonna crush us with a boulder?!
2085,"What? Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself,"
2087,"Look, I'm sorry, Summer, I feel bad that I let you drag us into this, I wish I could have been a better grandpa to you, and, you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice, cute top that you're wearing there,"
2095,"Good job, Summer, and thanks, girls, You know, you girls are really something, I'll tell you that, You know when we first got there, I was like -- Give them a ship now,"
2124,"Out of the -- out of the way, Morty!"
2126,"Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe!"
2146,"Isn't it interesting, Summer, that after all that stuff we just did, nothing really mattered and there was no point to it? Kind of makes you wonder, huh -- about nothing?"
2148,"No, I'd say, given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time and any epiphanies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity, But, hey, why don't you have a pink spaceship? Go ride around and have a jolly old time, Maybe that'll shut you up,"
2152,"Oh, that's interesting, Beth, You know, it's funny, I-I-I heard about a little bit of news myself, Take a look, T-take a listen,"
2154,"Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs! This this world still got a -- it's still got a chance! Yeah! Ha ha! See you -- see you guys next week! See everybody next week,"
2170,"Well, if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered and the entire show was stupid,"
2172,"Thought you'd never ask,"
2176,How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn?
2180,"Summer you just spent three months watching a man chose a fake wife,"
2182,"Jerry, you don't get it, This is infinite TV from infinite universes, Look,"
2184,"A movie about a guy eating shit, A violent antique show,"
2189,"I agree, Where is this going?"
2191,"Really? All right, fine,"
2193,"All right, Jerry, When you're right, you're right, Now I'm hooked,"
2196,"Amazing -- a dimension where all proper nouns begin with ""Shmla,"""
2198,"All right, that actually got old pretty quick,"
2200,"Infinity's a big number, Jerry, I don't remember the channel,"
2202,"Geez, Actor Jerry: You speak the true-true,"
2207,"Infinite timelines, infinite possibilities, including a timeline where Jerry's a movie star, Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect to this device, Wha -- look at this,"
2220,"Now, who wants to watch random, crazy tv shows from different dimensions, and -- and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate selves?"
2222,"  Here, these scan your retinas and let you view parallel timelines through genetically matching versions of your eyes, Go fetch,"
2225,I'm proud of you Morty 
2252,"Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone,"
2268,"Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? Mmm! Oh, boy, Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad, You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called ""Ball Fondlers,"" I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse,"
2269,"I'm in heaven right now,"
2279,"Interesting fun fact -- Moynihan and a piece of toast hate each other, Apparently, they've got some real creative differences,"
2282,"Relax, Morty, Don't -- don't worry about it, Let's just see where this goes,"
2285,"Huh, He's making himself a sandwich now,"
2288,"Oh, my god, It's still the commercial,"
2296,"Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where -- where those sex robots came from? Remember that whole thing?"
2298,"Yeah, Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield,"
2305,"No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music, In this reality, he's still alive,"
2307,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure, He also did the voice of that one guy from ""Ghostbusters,"" which is really strange because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie, But then, when they made the movie, Bill murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean,"
2309,"I don't know, Just making conversation with you, Morty, What, you think I'm a -- I'm -- I know everything about everything?"
2320,"Well, you know, Morty I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you got to pump the gas a little, Pedal to the metal, Morty,"
2323,"Sex sells, Morty,"
2331,"Speaking of what, Morty what should we watch next? What about this? Detective: Babylegs, you're a good detective, But not good enough, because of your baby legs, So I'm partnering you up with regular legs,"
2347,"Pretty cool, huh, Morty?"
2349,"I don't give a bleep What you think, Jerry,"
2375,"Oh, hey, Morty, You just missed a preview for your dad's ""Citizen kane,"""
2381,"Come on, Are you kidding me, Jerry? It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap,"
2385,"Wh-- what are you asking me for, Jerry? I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out, I mean they got a clear shot to your head, I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this,"
2390,"Hey, ""Ball Fondlers""? Huh, ""Ball Fondlers""?"
2396,"Yes, sweetie, That's where the live,"
2399,"Look, I don't know, I'm watching the same thing you guys are,"
2401,"I don't know, Summer, I can't even hear the TV, All right, that's it, We're just gonna go there so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day,"
2406,"Whatever,"
2408,"Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing,"
2414,"Pass the butter, Thank you,"
2418,"I'm busy,"
2420,"Uh, anything else, Robot: What is my purpose?"
2421,"You pass butter,"
2423,"Yeah, welcome to the club, pal,"
2424,Since when you have a job?
2426,"Meow, Can't wait to meet this Fascinating character,"
2433,"Huh,"
2435,"Eh, I make my own stuff, So, what are you -- like, the devil?"
2437,"I don't know, Store comes out of nowhere, all the shit's old and creepy, Are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?"
2439,"Hey, I'm not judging, Just like shoot straight, I'm a man of science,"
2464,"Hey, Morty, let me--let me-- let me ask you a question real quick, Does evil exist, and if so, - can one detect and measure it?"
2466,"Rhetorical question, Morty, The answer's ""yes, you just have to be a genius,"" Cute, Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded,"
2468,"Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled, I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded,"
2470,"Well, that's retarded,"
2472,"Apparently, nothing,"
2477,"Stay scientific, Jerry,"
2480,"This serum should counteract the negative effects,"
2482,"Here, You can have this back,"
2484,"Sure I did -- to develop this, It detects and catalogs all your ""Twilight Zone,"" Ray Bradbury, ""Friday the 13th"" the series voodoo crap magic, I thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say,,, A typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries and then makes the murders happen in real life? Ooh,"
2486,"Don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting? You're not intentionally selling,,, Beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?"
2488,"Oh, I say, good sir, Oh, harrumph, Oh, oh"
2491,You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours?
2493,"Here, you can use my phone, Don't worry, It won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack, You think you're bleep so great, you stupid piece of bleep shit,"
2495,"You work for the devil,"
2499,"Whoops,"
2541,"Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but bleep with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to ""Curse Purge Plus,"" I use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers, This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless, I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million, See you at the olympics, This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family, Now it does their taxes, Everything's deductible, Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul, Pay for it with money, You know, like how every other store in the world works? We're located at first and main in old town, Come on -- come on down, ""first and,,,""   ,,,""needful things,"" where you can get evil items for free!"
2574,"Looks like we've got,,, haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity, I can take out the ""eternity"" And the padding, and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens, Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby, How's business?"
2576,"Sounds like code for ""You win, Rick,"""
2578,"Nope, It was important to your dumb devil friend, To me, this was all just a bit, like when Bugs Bunny bleep With the opera singer for 20 minutes,"
2580,"Seriously? Holy crap, Holy crap,"
2582,"Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care,"
2586,"I always do,"
2588,"Yeah, it is good, It's the best,"
2590,"Later,"
2592,"Yeah, uh... give me a sec,"
2594,"All right, yeah, put -- put them on my,,,eh, I just got bored, Everybody out,"
2609,"Hey, Morty, you want to go on a ,,, oh, Hey, Beth, Hello? Hey, Jerry, you in here being stupid?"
2611,"Thanks, Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie,"
2613,"Suit yourself, buurp   Hey,Hey, W-w-what's going on?"
2615,"Whatever,"
2656,"How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka ""the devil""?"
2658,"Oof, Sorry,"
2660,"Not sure,"
2662,"No, that's dumb,"
2664,"I'll tell you what, though, If -- if -- if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea,"
2670,Stupid motherbleep
2672,Stupid motherbleep How do you like that? How do you like that?
2680,"It was totally worth it, We did it, We just pulled it off,"
2685,Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
2689,"Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine."
2694,"Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.   Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me."
2698,Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C-137. You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of Ricks.
2700,Neutralise the Jerry.
2706,"Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let's get it over with."
2707,Bring his mo-buurp-orty.
2709,Leave my buurp Morty out of this!
2710,You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join buurp the council. 
2712,Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?
2720,The citadel of Ricks. It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.
2722,"As you know, Morty, I've got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government: wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers."
2724,"Geez, you're easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who's-who of who's you and me."
2725,"Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement, with some Morty dazzlers!"
2726,"Hey, check this out!"
2729,Dumb.
2730,"'Scuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-"
2731,"Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place."
2733,I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick. 
2734,"Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick!"
2735,"Hey, save your Rick rules for the buurp sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig!"
2736,"bleep me, pal."
2737,"bleep you? No no no no no, bleep me!"
2739,Bring up the holograms!
2741,"Twenty-seven Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, Earth Rick C-137?"
2742,You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?
2743,You buurp have a history of non-cooperation with the council. 
2744,"Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn't he here in handcuffs?"
2745,Because he's dead too!
2747,"Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you're the malcontent. The rogue."
2748,I'm the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me. 
2750,"Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!"
2751,Evidence? Good idea. Scan his portal gun!
2753,"Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's portal gun history. We-we all go to weird places. "
2754,"Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured!"
2756,What? That's Rick-diculous. I'm obviously being set up! 
2757,"Earth Rick C-137! The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls."
2758,I've heard enough.
2760,"Run, Morty!"
2766,Nooo!
2767,Arrrrgh! Ahhhh!
2768,Aaaah!
2769,Oof!
2786,They could have gone into any one of these.
2792,That'll keep 'em buurp busy for a while.
2794,"'Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names."
2796,By finding the real Rick killer.
2798,"Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now. "
2800,"Alright, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. You just gotta keep 'em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer. "
2802,"Oh yeah! Mmm! Oh, delicious!"
2803,"Beth, buurp you're a treasure. "
2804,"I have a Beth just like you in my buurp reality, except you know what? She's not as brilliant or buurp attractive!"
2806,Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!
2809,"Hey Jerry, it's Rick."
2811,"So listen, the heat's on and buurp there's nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole."
2813,"Is that cool with you, dog?"
2815,I got it! The call's coming from... inside the house!
2818,The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won't be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they'll be on to us.
2820,"Yeah, more phonesticks please."
2823,"Yeah, it's gotta be that way. You're a camouflage."
2825,"Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh,   Morty waves."
2827,"Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let's go!"
2829,Uh-oh!
2830,"'Scuse me, we've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion I'm going to mark us each with a red X right now. That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying. "
2831,"Hey, check it out!"
2833,Dammit!
2836,The red X! Red X!
2838,"Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?"
2840,"Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found."
2842,"Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is. "
2845,"Not people, Morty. Mortys."
2848,"Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put 'em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherbleep. I fiddled with a buurp concept like this once."
2850,"On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn't do this, it's barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable.   Which I also wouldn't do! I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship."
2856,Hi Jerry! 
2858,"Oh, you are? Wh-wh-what do you do?"
2860,"Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them?"
2862,"Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together!"
2864,"Oh gosh, wh- I hope not! I-I-I-I wouldn't want to offend you in any way!"
2866,Ohoho! Y-of course I am! Just as much as my Morty's a Morty!
2869,"That's right, Jerry! He-he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people! He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty! They assigned him to me because... I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I'd love 'em  if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry."
2871,"Hey, get a load of this! Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick. "
2872,"Haha, this is perfect. "
2873,I'm not doofus Rick! I'm Rick J-19-Zeta-7! 
2874,"Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?"
2875,Hey! I don't eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me!
2877,"I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry... I'm the worst Rick of them all."
2879,"Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I-I guess that's why you work in advertising!"
2883,"Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy! "
2885,"Yeah, that's right! You are! You're a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, Morty! Because you're as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say 'shut up' it's really good advice."
2887,"Great, nice work, Morty. "
2889,Urrgh.
2891,"Ooh, look at you, C-137! You're- aren't you a tough customer? "
2892,"The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude."
2893,"Not in this dimension it isn't. In fact, hah, I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before. "
2894,Well lah-dee-dah.  
2895,"Hey, that's mine!"
2897,"I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape."
2899,"Don't be Rickdiculous, Morty."
2901,Take his Morty away.
2910,"Ahh, isn't it beautiful? "
2911,"Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!"
2913,That guy got it.
2914,"Ah-ah Rick, quiet. You're missing my symphony."
2916,"Hey, I'll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!"
2918,This guy is on it!
2919,"He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That's just a random noise it makes every ten seconds."
2921,Awww.
2922,"See, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We're not so buurp different, you and I."
2924,"Yeah, duh!"
2925,"See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers, I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed 'em out from most evil to least evil. Here's where I am. And look at right here's where you are, Rick. This guy right here? Super weird."
2926,"I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you're going with this? 'Cause that's where I'd be going."
2927,"Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own. I'm simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you."
2929,"Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate: ovenless brownies! "
2932,"Well, come on, I can't take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. C'mere Jerry!"
2937,"You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is... you bought 'em 'cause you like 'em. They have value to you. That's what matters."
2939,Until we find your Rick.
2960,"You've lived quite a life, Rick. It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through."
2962,You're crying? Over a Morty? 
2963,"No, I'm just allergic to dipshits."
2964,"Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys."
2966,"Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!"
2968,Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!
2971,"Point taken, but this is buurp no time for arcs. "
2973,"Yeah, hello?"
2974,"Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common? "
2975,Huh? Wh-who is this?
2976,"I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!"
2978,Yo ding-dong! We're done here. Time to go. 
2979,"Well Jerry, I buurp guess this means goodbye. "
2981,"Jerry. W-we both know it wouldn't work. It's time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love ya."
2985,"They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls... poor little Rickless bastards."
2987,"Earth Rick C-137, the council apologises for its false accusation. And in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty, in the event that buurp your current buurp Morty should-"
2988,"Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let's hit it."
2992,"Alright, Morty, don't break an arm jerking yourself off."
2994,"Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would buurp go without saying that the Rickest Rick... would have the Mortyest Morty."
2996,"Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?"
2998,"Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody."
3000,I-I-I'll explain when you're older.
3002,What a mess...
3003,Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved.
3006,Hand me the laser defibrillator. 
3007,"Hey guys! Uh, c-can I help?"
3008,No! Go clean the toilets! Maybe you'll make friends with some turds!
3009,You make us ashamed to be ourselves!
3011,"My god! I've seen this technology before! This Rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver!"
3012,"Yeah, but where's the transmitter?"
3017,"Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?"
3019,"Alright. Okay, get out. "
3021,"What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I've got like buurp ten Ricks to call right now!"
3025,"Have fun, you two,"
3029,"I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage,"
3034,"Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine, And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever, It's like that old song ""Blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop,"" Y-you guys know that song? From Tiny Rogerts? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s? No-nobody? A-all right, whatever, Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip,"
3043,"Uh, Summer, you can't have a party,"
3045,"Because I'm having a party, b-i-i-i-itch!"
3048,"""Glip glop?"" You're lucky a traflorkian doesn't hear you say that,"
3050,"It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for jews,"
3053,"That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17,"
3055,"To get wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!"
3057,"Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes,"
3077,Birdperson!
3079,"Oh, there's an emergency, all right, A bleep emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?"
3081,"Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah, Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson,"
3083,"Uh... people? Mm, six, Yo! What up, my glip glops?!"
3094,"Uh-huh, Yeah, No, no, to-totally,"
3096,Morty! Have you met Gearhead?
3098,"Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the gear wars,"
3101,"Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy Scropon?"
3103,"Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed, Have a little perspective,"
3105,Aw! Squanchy!
3107,"Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man, Mi casa es su casa, dawg!"
3110,"Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax,"
3112,"Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out, Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?"
3116,"Knock it off, Slow Mobius!"
3119,"Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go, Talk to her, Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood,"
3149,"Whoa, Not cool, Summer, This is a party, Everybody should be welcome,"
3151,"Oh, great, Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?"
3153,"It's not the same, Summer, Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln, Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser,"
3159,"Don't look at me, dude,"
3166,"Kick his ass, Brad! Kick his ass!"
3171,"I just did you a favor, Morty,"
3188,"Huh, Big star in the sky,   Oxygen-rich atmosphere, Giant testicle monsters, We'll be fine! Let's party!"
3191,"Oh, man, Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one,"
3193,"Relax, Morty, relax! It's gonna be fine, All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals,"
3195,"Oh, shit, motherbleep kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles south of here,"
3197,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Morty, morty, I-I can't go with you, I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?"
3200,"Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you,"
3202,"Shut up, Lincoler, It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room,"
3233,"All right! You did it, Morty,"
3235,"Well, at least he didn't die in vain, He got these crystals,   And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something, S-somebody, play something,"
3238," Put your right foot forward   And your left foot back   Then slide around like on a nordictrack   Move to the left   Step to the right   Wiggle your elbows, and look up into the light   It's the, it's the   It's the Rick dance   It's the, it's the   It's the Rick dance "
3239,"Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!    It's the, it's the   It's the Rick dance "
3240,"That's the Rick dance! All right! Whoa, man!"
3242,"What? No, no, no, I can get us home whenever I want to, But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty, Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high,"
3245,"Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson? Uh, squanchy? Don't squaunch at me,"
3247,"All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!"
3249,"Boo! Morty, you're the worst, Morty,"
3293,"Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop,"
3295,"Uh, all -- all right, All right, Hold -- hold on,   Ahh! So good,"
3297,"Bring me the thing,"
3299,"The thing, The thing, The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it, It -- it -- it beeps,"
3302,"Summer for -- for the win, All right, that should do it,"
3304,"Uh, s-see for yourself,"
3306,"Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time, Yeah, and Slow Mobius thinks he's all that,"
3308,"I don't know, How long do you guys want? A week? A month?"
3311,"Worst movie ever,"
3316,"Don't need to, I have a new catchphrase,"
3318,"I love my grandkids,"
3320,"Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, ""I don't give a bleep""  Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got   Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got  Roll credits!  Just shake that a--  Roll the credits! Go!  Just shake that ass  That's the end of season one! That's the end, motherbleep ""I don't give a bleep"" is my new catchphrase! bleep you! That's season one! Boom! Season one up in your face, motherbleep Yeah!"
3338,Who cares about the buurp thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a bleep. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing. 
3340,"Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize. "
3342,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards. "
3344,And away we go! 
3348,"Shhh, Morty! "
3351,"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety. "
3358,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do--why do--why--why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,   go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts. "
3364,Uh oh. 
3371,"Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.   Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep. "
3377,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! "
3383,"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson. "
3395,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell? 
3397,"Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do? "
3401,buurp Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now? 
3406,"Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.  "
3415,Shut up!   Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain! 
3420,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical. 
3422,"We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look. "
3426,"I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.  "
3428,"""Mom and Dad?"" Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their bleep marriage. "
3451,"This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible."
3454,"Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be ""is"". "
3457,"We ""isn't"" "
3458,"Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time. "
3460,"Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go! "
3462,"Huh, what do you know, it's working "
3465,Oh shit. 
3467,What the hell is wrong with you two!? I--I m--I m--I mean you four!? 
3469,"Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both buurp all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out! "
3475,"Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be ""Grampa's favorite."" I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway. "
3497,"So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world? "
3499,"Alright, perfect. Sit still, buurp arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa. "
3501,What's that? You got something to say? 
3502,And away we go! 
3504,And away we go! 
3505,"Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God. "
3507,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me! 
3508,"Follicle unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it? He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now... "
3509,"Don't you get it? don't you get it? The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now... "
3511,Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you! 
3514,You see that? Get down. 
3517,I told you he's a psycho! 
3518,He's lost it. The time fracture must have made him crazy! 
3519,I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! 
3522,"Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK bleep? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE? "
3534,"Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right! "
3544,"Oh God, my head. What did you guys do? "
3547,"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.  "
3549,"Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal. "
3551,"Calling myself. Here, listen, buurp it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself. "
3552,"Hello, Rick here. "
3553,"Don't fall for it, it's a bit. "
3554,"Just kidding, haha! You just got Ricked. You've reached Rick's voicemail, you know what to do  . "
3555,"Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails.   You get the idea buurp we're cool now. "
3557,Fine I'll just do it myself. 
3559,"Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds. "
3581,"Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land. "
3585,"Uh, we did... "
3586,We're not wearing collars. 
3588,buurp What? 
3591,"Alright, fine. Summer, Morty, put 'em on. "
3593,"Yes, we're back, problem solved. "
3597,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing. 
3602,"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him! "
3616,What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you? 
3618,"Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you. "
3621,"Ah, God, gross and weird! "
3626,"Summer, Morty, take off your collars! "
3628,Good question. I suppose the answer is: I'm not certain! 
3631,I have no idea! 
3632,I'm not sure. 
3634,"Maybe I will, maybe I won't. "
3636,"I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass! "
3649,"Time is falling apart, we've got to get back to certainty, quick! Give me your collars! "
3651,"Morty, I have to fix three of them, and then there's thirty-one other versions of me that have to also fix three for a total of 96. I'm not an idiot. I know how to be decisive, now hand me that  . "
3653,"Oh, shit. "
3672,"Okay, we're out of time. It's ironic, huh? "
3674,What's goin' on? 
3681,"What are you talking about, it's not broken, Morty, I fixed it, just put it on! "
3683,"Fine, bring it here. "
3690,Goddammit! 
3692,Morty where's your collar I'll fix it 
3695,"I'm okay with this. Be good Morty. Be better than me. bleep The other collar! I'm not okay with this! I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus please let me live. Oh, my God I--I've gotta fix this thing, please God in Heaven, please, God, oh Lord, hear my prayers. Yes! bleep you God! Not today, bitch. "
3697,"Yes I did it! There is no God! In your face. One dot, motherbleep! "
3701,"You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that. "
3705,Yeah. 
3707,"Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s--piece of shit. "
3716,No it doesn't. It hurts. 
3738,"Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You're gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me. "
3740,"  Alright Morty, lesson's over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here. "
3742,"  WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?! "
3744,"I guess I remember that.   Wow. And you've just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don't have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917. "
3746,Yep. 
3749,"Nope.   This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here. "
3769,"You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well... I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy's rich. "
3771,"  Trust me Morty, I've heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don't tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn't be safer. "
3773,"Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number's your dad. If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back. "
3777,"Okay, wait here. "
3779,"Don't come with. It's boring, it's buurp business stuff. "
3781,"Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th--in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip 'em in cocaine, and they wipe 'em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn't shady. "
3783,"Ah, crap.   Hey, what's up? "
3785,"Can... Can we please...? This is my grandson, Morty. "
3787,"Ugh.   Here, now go away. "
3789,Y-Y-Y-You're gonna give him your card?! 
3793,"Ugh... You've got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It's more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these? "
3795,An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz! 
3797,"Aw, this place is the best. It's got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is. "
3799,"Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty.   Here, check this out. "
3836,"Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase. "
3838,"Morty. You were just playing a game. It's called Roy. Snap out of it, come on.   "
3840,Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo. 
3843,"It's also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there's not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That's why he does it for a living? Now if you'll excuse me, it's time to thrash your Roy score.   "
3845,"Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store. "
3887,"What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don't have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don't get along! "
3893,"Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart! "
3895,"Morty, don't do it.   Morty, you idiot! "
3897,"We can't get him outta here. He's gaseous. He's not gonna make it through a portal, Morty. "
3902,"Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don't wanna deal with this! "
3906,Screw this. I'm out. 
3913,Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherbleep!   Move! 
3915,"Wait, did you bleep with my seat settings? "
3920,"Yeah, yeah.   "
3924,"That's 'cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact. "
3926,"  Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home. "
3928,I'm being polite. 
3930,"Yeah, where's that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it? "
3932,"Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump! "
3934,  Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch... 
3940,"  Shut the bleep up about moonmen! This isn't a musical number. This is a bleep operation, we gotta be cool and bleep lay low! "
3956,Son of a...   Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the bleep is so valuable about you? 
3958,  Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that's gonna be to my work? 
3960,Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead...   
3962,"Number One is me, asshole! You're supposed to be my friend! "
3967,"Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it's time to go. "
3976,"Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices? "
3978,Tell that to Gearhead's gearsticles. 
3980,"Wrong! I'd be playin' Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty. "
3998,"Morty, take the wheel! "
4001,Whoa! 
4003,"Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?!   Haha, I'm kidding, I know that's on me. "
4006,"Shit. Well, I guess this is it. "
4019,"Damn. Can't blame that on the dog. ...Talk about silent but deadly. I-I've seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I'm sayin'? "
4021,"I'll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don't like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like...if I said Gasablanca! ...Alright, I'm done.   Let's get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin' a life! "
4063,"Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I'm gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.   That's my new word for 'shit' because of today's events. "
4079,"So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?   Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you. "
4081,"Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin' that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn't for nothin', you know?   You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I've got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they're all coming to visit. "
4083,"Too late, Morty. The hole's opening. "
4086,Th-there's a lot more where that came from too. 
4089,Hey.   Hey bro. How many people was your Roy responsible for killing today? 
4090,"None, we chilled at Blips and Chitz all day, ain't that right homie? "
4092,Haha! 
4094,"  Must be nice... Hey, Morty, there's our Jerry. "
4097,Glad you're safe Jerry. What do you say we go home? 
4099,"  Hey, wait, do you have 5126? "
4100,"Uh, I'm not sure. Morty. "
4102,"Uh, that's a Blips and Chitz ticket. "
4104,"Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever. "
4107,"Alright, come on, Jerry. "
4112,"It's the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial! "
4118,Yeah Morty
4120,It's my favourite song
4123,"Oh yeah, distress beacon! buurp Yeah baby!"
4125,"The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!"
4128,"One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!"
4132,"Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship."
4135,This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.
4137,"I hear you man, cops are racist."
4139,"Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God."
4142,And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.
4147,Called it.
4149,Unity!?
4152,"Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date."
4155,Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?
4160,"Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up."
4187,"World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what's next? "
4189,"Oh, goody."
4193,"buurp I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here? "
4195,"Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker."
4198,"Hey, listen, I've grown too. I have! See, I've- I've reconnected with my family, right? "
4200,Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with... a collective.
4203,Oh yeah!
4205,"Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father! "
4216,Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!
4228,Oh my god. Oh my god.  
4230,What's this 'was' stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we're doing that again! 
4233,"Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I'll- I'll be back to have sex with the survivors. "
4238,All bad I hope.  
4240,"Whoa, Jesus Christ!"
4243,Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?
4245,"Come on, it's not every day that I'm in town! It- it's for old time's sake. "
4247,"Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but..."
4250,"I can do whatever you do and more, baby."
4253,"You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical."
4286,"You got that right. But... baby, listen. Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta... you gotta just... remember to let go sometimes, you know."
4289,Whoa! 
4291,Whoa! That's not what I meant! 
4294,"  Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? ... H-hey, my drink is empty."
4358,What the hell... is your problem? 
4360,"Fine, geez! "
4362,See ya!
4364,"Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here."
4367,Oh my god buurp you guys I get it. You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away. 
4372,"Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks. Unity?"
4374,"Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up."
4377,I think you two are a little outnumbered. 
4379,What? Dumb. Bye.
4381,"Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what's the word I'm looking for here... uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can't give a crap about it. Take a hike. "
4384,"I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?"
4413,"Aaah!   Alright, I'm bored."
4415,"Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?"
4417,Never! Back in a flash.
4419,"Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let's see how long we can go!"
4421,Hey Une! You got any more-
4429,Hey.
4431,Okay.
4433,No. It's your house. 
4435,"Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we're talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It's not cool. Fun's fun but who needs it? I'll be in the garage. "
4439,Unity! Unity! Unity! 
4442,"I wanna talk to buurp Unity. Beta-7, I know it's in there!"
4444,"I know your game, Beta-7, I've met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!"
4446,"Well, you're just loving this, mother f- this isn't gonna shape out like you think, pal! Unity's not into other hiveminds! It's gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now I'm going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me! Get out here!"
4448,"Oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems. "
4450,"We are, Morty. Alright, Beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch! "
4452,"""they're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy, they just put you at the center of their lives because your powerful then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen tho right."" "
4468,"Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions. "
4471,Who the bleep are you? 
4476,"Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an ""Uncle Steve"". That is an alien parasite. "
4479,"No you haven't Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting. "
4481,"He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit. "
4483,"Get off the high road Summer, we all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet. "
4485,"No, ""Steve"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up. "
4487,Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you. 
4489,"Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer. "
4491,Can't afford to chance it. 
4494,Trust me Beth you don't wanna know how many answers that question has. 
4498,Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?   
4510,"Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real. "
4512,I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder. 
4524,Wait. 
4526,No! Don't flashback! 
4534,Take that! 
4544,"Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house. "
4546,"No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites. "
4549,"All right, there's six of us, buurp and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer. "
4551,"6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at? "
4553,"Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!   Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that. "
4568,"That is su-- buurp -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to - "
4575,"Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl.   "
4577,"Hold still, ""Summer."" "
4579,"Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you. "
4581,"Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you? "
4584,"Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan? "
4587,"You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing. "
4589,"Watch me, baby. I'm like tom cruise from, um, ""cuisine"" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like tom cruise from ""cuisine.""   yeah. Is that what it's called? ""cuisine""? "
4591,"Wait.   Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a ""Where's Waldo?"" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages. "
4594,"Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out.   "
4597,"You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition ""Zelda"" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff. "
4599,"Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that "
4618,"Uh, no thank --   Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here? "
4621,"So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein? "
4623,"No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein!   Give it back! "
4625,  Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?! 
4635,"Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago! "
4639,"Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls!   yeah! Say that all the time. "
4642,"Beth, I'm your father! "
4645,"Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name? "
4649,"Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too. "
4651,"Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty! "
4653,"Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, motherbleep Pull the bleep trigger! "
4656,What the hell? 
4660,"Holy crap, Morty, you're right. "
4662,"Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough.   "
4663,"Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate.   "
4666,We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator? 
4670,"Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer? "
4689,"  Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything. "
4691,You're right.   Kill Pencilvester. 
4704,I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan? 
4706,"Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.   "
4723,"From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone. "
4725,"At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Ricky ticky tavi! "
4728,"No, Beth! Oh bleep "
4739,"Oh, geez! Oh, my god! "
4743,"Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale. "
4745,"He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the ""you shot me"" equivalent of not being mad. "
4750,  And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. 
4765,"Oh boy. Time to go, Morty. "
4768,"The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon. buurp The lame one, here on Earth. "
4779,Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight. 
4792,Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes! 
4795,My name is Rick Sanchez. This here's my grandson Morty.   
4798,"I've seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we've got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.   This head won't go away until buurp Earth shows them it's got a hit song. "
4801,"No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms. "
4803,You're gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51. 
4811,"Good luck, Mr. President. "
4815,"I dabble, Mr. President. "
4827,"Who's NOT a musician, Morty? "
4829,"Yeah, not with that attitude. "
4835,WhooooOOOOAHHHH!!!! 
4837,"  All right, Morty, let's get ready to do it! Why don't you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat? "
4839,"Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat! "
4842,Ahhhhh yeahhhhh 
4850,Take off your pants and your panties 
4856,Take a shit on the floor 
4863,"Hey, take your pants off "
4885,I think planet Earth has just been transported. 
4897,"Uhh, it's probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead. "
4910,Whoa ho ho ho ho! 
4911,"Geez, Morty. The guy's just doing his job. Take it easy. "
4913,"Genius happens in the moment, Morty.   "
4915,"That's planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.   Balls. "
4917,"Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There's only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we're not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it? "
4919,"Yeah, buurp you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities, buurp Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can't get schwifty. "
4921,"Hey, Morty! Could you lick my...   "
4953,"Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second! "
4959,"Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that! "
4961,"Morty, just put it down. You don't know what you're doing. "
4964,Nooooo! 
4966,"Ahhhh, sh ! "
4994,"Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed. "
4996,"Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or... ? "
4998,"Ice, I don't want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but buurp if Morty doesn't come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it's, uh, kind of your problem too. "
5003,What the f ? You can turn into ice? 
5005,"Take it from me, Ice. buurp You can't just buurp float around space not caring about stuff forever. "
5063,"Ahem.   Uhhh... lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts. "
5071,"Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups... ooh, tough crowd. "
5078,Morty! 
5102,I say...   Let's do it! 
5104,All right! 
5106,"Come on, here we go! "
5108,Say it with me! 
5140,"Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch... snake holster on the leg. "
5167,"Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse! "
5169,We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherbleep! 
5171,Oh great. 
5173,"Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside. "
5175,"The battery Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y. "
5177,"You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe. "
5203,"Morty, remember eight seconds ago when buurp when you said 'go inside what' and I said 'the battery' and then we showed up here "
5208,"OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE, W-W-WHERE'S THE PEPPER?"
5210,"YES, SUMMER, VAMPIRES ARE REAL, WHO KNEW? OH, RIGHT, ALL HUMANITY, FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, NOW,"
5213,"WE'RE GONNA LIVE OUR LIVES UNTIL WE DIE, POSSIBLY BY VAMPIRE, MORE LIKELY AUTO ACCIDENT OR HEART DISEASE, BUT POSSIBLY VAMPIRE,"
5216,"YEAH, PRETTY SPECIFIC PITCH, SUMMER, I PROBABLY COULD TURN MYSELF INTO A TEENAGER AND HANG OUT IN THE ZIT-COVERED, HORMONE-ADDLED, LOW-STAKES ASSWORLD THAT IS HIGH SCHOOL, BUT HERE'S MY REVERSE-ASK -- WHY IN THE bleep WOULD I EVER DO THAT, EVER? AND HOW DARE YOU EVEN ASK ME THAT? AND WHY AREN'T YOU MORE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?"
5225,JESUS CHRIST! WILL YOU FIX YOUR MARRIAGE OR GET A DIVORCE ALREADY?
5227,"THAT'S EARTH THERAPY, YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK A HORSE TO FIX A MERRY-GO-ROUND, I MEAN, HE'LL TRY HIS BEST, BUT MOSTLY, HE'S JUST GONNA GET HORRIFIED, I KNOW ABOUT A PLACE OFF-PLANET WITH A 100% SUCCESS RATE,"

5744,"OKAY, S-SORRY ABOUT THAT, NOW, WHERE ARE THESE RICH PEOPLE?"
5750,"HERE'S THE DEAL, I'M NOT HERE TO JUDGE, I'M JUST A GUY FROM ANOTHER PLANET, BUT THIS GIRL IS ONE OF YOUR POOR PEOPLE, AND I GUESS YOU GUYS FELT LIKE IT WAS OKAY TO SUBJECT HER TO INHUMAN CONDITIONS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF IT EVER HURTING YOU, IT'S SORT OF THE SOCIO-POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF, SAY, A SUIT OF POWER ARMOR AROUND YOU, BUT NOW THINGS ARE EVENED OUT, SO, ARTHRISHA?"
5753,"GEEZ,"
5756,"NO, I REALLY -- HONESTLY, I-I'VE HAD MY FILL, IT'S GRATUITOUS AT THIS POINT,"
5759,"YEAH, BUT -- AH, ALL RIGHT, bleep IT,"
5763,"OKAY, NOW IT'S TIME WE DO A LITTLE DANCING TO -- TO TONY! TONI! TONe!"

5778,"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, bleep YOU FOR SHOOTING MY LIVER, I'LL SEE YOU AROUND,"
5792,"WELL, A HELPFUL RULE MIGHT BE IF YOU NEED SOMETHING, YOU GET IT, PRETTY SIMPLE, RIGHT?"
5794,WHO'S GOT FOOD FOR THAT GUY?
5801,"ALL RIGHT, OKAY, FAIR IS FAIR, IF YOU DO EXTRA WORK, YOU GET EXTRA FOOD,"
5813,"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MORTY, REMEMBER THOSE CANDY BARS EARLIER THAT WE GOT IN THE FIRST ACT?"
5815,"TURNS OUT THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL IN THEM CALLED PURGENOL THAT AMPLIFIES ALL YOUR VIOLENT TENDENCIES,"
5817,"YEP, DON'T EVEN SWEAT, YOU'RE STILL THE SAME OLD MORTY, YOUR CHARACTER'S TOTALLY PROTECTED,"
5837,"UH, W-WHY DON'T YOU GET IT, JERRY? YOU'RE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE, AND YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB,"
5841,"IT'S A COURIER FLAP, IT'S LIKE THE INTERGALACTIC VERSION OF U,P,S,, BUT LESS OFF-PUTTING, OH, SHIIIT! IT LOOKS LIKE AN EGG-VITE FROM BIRDPERSON, MUST BE TIME FOR HIS ANNUAL OSCAR PARTY, AND, BY THE WAY, OUR TV SIGNALS TAKE LIGHT YEARS TO REACH HIS PLANET, NOBODY TELL HIM THAT ""BRAVEHEART"" WINS,"
5846,BLUGH!
5852,"UH, L-LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY, MORTY,"
5854,"NO, WEDDINGS ARE BASICALLY FUNERALS WITH CAKE, IF I WANTED TO WATCH SOMEONE THROW THEIR LIFE AWAY, buurp I'D HANG OUT WITH JERRY ALL DAY,"
5860,"WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, JERRY?"
5867,"I ASSUME PLANET SQUANCH -- 6,000 LIGHT YEARS ACROSS THE GALAXY,"
5869,"YEAH, I KNOW, NOW WE HAVE TO GO TO THE WEDDING,"
5872,"HEY, WHAT'S UP, SQUANCHY? Summer and Morty: HEY, SQUANCHY,"
5875,"BETH, SQUANCHY CULTURE IS MORE CONTEXTUAL THAN LITERAL, YOU JUST SAY WHAT'S IN YOUR SQUANCH AND PEOPLE UNDERSTAND,"
5889,"YEAH, I JUST HOPE YOU GOT A PRE-MELD,"
5891,"WHAT?! IT'S JUST A PRACTICAL WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT WHEN SHE'S DONE WITH YOU, YOU CAN GET ONE OF YOUR BALLS BACK,"
5894,"OHH, I-I WAS HAPPY ON THE FLIGHT, I'M GRUMPY FROM THE LANDING,"
5915,"BIRDPERSON'S BIG DAY, MORTY, WAS AT BLOOD RIDGE ON GLAPFLAP'S THIRD MOON AGAINST THE GROMFLAMITES! THIS? THIS IS A LOSING BATTLE,"
5920,"GOOD ONE, MORTY, EXCUSE ME, BARTENDER, CAN YOU MAKE ME A DUMB GRANDSON PEP TALK? IT'S ONE PART LAME ADVICE ABOUT STUFF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AND A LOT OF VODKA,"
5922,"THEN I'LL TAKE ONE OF THOSE, I DON'T NEED THE REST,"
5943,buurp
5949,"UH, HI, EVERYBODY, I'M RIbuurpCK, YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST MET BIRDPERSON, HE WAS, UHH... LISTEN, I'M NOT THE NICEST GUY IN THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE I'M THE SMARTEST, AND BEING NICE IS SOMETHING STUPID PEOPLE DO TO HEDGE THEIR BETS, NOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY SUBTLE ABOUT HOW LITTLE I TRUST MARRIAGE, I COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK, AND I COULD TURN A BLACK HOLE INTO A SUN, SO AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT ARE THE ODDS THIS IS LEGIT AND NOT JUST SOME BIG LIE WE'RE ALL TELLING OURSELVES BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID TO DIE ALONE? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW WE ALL DIE -- ALONE,"
5953,"BUT -- BUT... HERE'S THE THING, BIRDPERSON IS MY BEST FRIEND, AND IF HE LOVES TAMMY, WELL, THEN I LOVE TAMMY, TOO,"
5955,"TO FRIENDSHIP, TO LOVE, AND TO MY GREATEST ADVENTURE YET -- OPENING MYSELF UP TO OTHERS,"

5991,"ALL THE IMPORTANT POINTS SEEM PRETTY CLEAR, NO? THEY THINK THEY CONTROL THE GALAXY, I DISAGREE, DON'T HATE THE PLAYER, HATE THE GAME, SON,"
5993,"OH! OH, SHOULD I HAVE BEEN MORE OPEN AND TRUSTING AND LOVING LIKE, OH, I DON'T KNOW, MY NOW DEAD BEST FRIEND? OR YOUR DAUGHTER, WHO IS BFFs WITH AN INTERGALACTIC NARC?"
5995,"AND NOW WE KNOW WHY,"
5997,"bleep YOU, SUMMER, AND bleep THE GOVERNMENT, AND bleep ME FOR LETTING MY GUARD DOWN, WHICH I WILL NEVER DO AGAIN,"
5999,"I JUST DID, MORTY, HERE'S DESSERT, bleep YOU,"
6001,"YEAH, ABOUT GOING HOME, WE CAN'T -- EVER,"
6003,"OH, THESE GUYS ARE LOOKING FOR US NOW, EARTH WILL BE SWARMING WITH THEM,"
6006,"LOOK, ANYONE THAT WANTS TO GO BACK TO EARTH IS FREE TO GO BACK TO EARTH, BUT HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, ALIENS BUREAUCRATS ARE GONNA ARREST YOU, THEY'RE GONNA PUT THE INTERGALACTIC EQUIVALENT OF buurp JUMPER CABLES UNDER YOUR NUTS AND OR LABIA AND HOOK THEM UP TO AN ALIEN CAR BATTERY UNTIL YOU TELL THEM WHERE I AM -- WHICH I GUARANTEE YOU, YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW, WHICH I GUARANTEE THEY WON'T BELIEVE, SO WHO'S HOMESICK? BY APPLAUSE,"
6008,LADIES? ANYBODY?
6010,"TAKE IT EASY, THIS IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE, bleep EARTH, YOU REALIZE OUR PLANET'S NAME MEANS DIRT, RIGHT? WE'LL FIND A NEW WORLD, COMPUTER, HOW MANY PLANETS IN THE MILKY WAY ARE AT LEAST 90% SIMILAR TO EARTH?"
6013,HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE OUTSIDE FEDERAL JURISDICTION?
6016,"SEE? OUR CUP RUNNETH OVER, NOW, WHO WANTS TO GO SHOPPING FOR A BRAND-NEW MOTHERbleep WORLD?! ALL RIGHT! LOOK AT THIS BABY! WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW THAT WASN'T EARTH?"
6018,"PSSH, WHITE-PEOPLE PROBLEMS, MORTY, LET'S GO DOWN AND CHECK HER OUT,"

6035,"UH, COMPUTER, HOW LONG ARE THE DAYS ON THIS PLANET?"
6038,"ALL RIGHT, WELL, THOSE ARE THE TWO CHOICES, 'CAUSE COB PLANET IS OFF THE TABLE, NOW LET'S TAKE A VOTE,"
6045,"GOOD MORNING, FAMILY, OH, DO I SMELL BACON?"
6049,"WELL, I THOUGHT I'D WALK TO THE SOUTH POLE AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF EXPLORING, IF YOU GUYS NEED ME, JUST YELL OR THROW SOMETHING SO HARD THAT IT GOES AROUND THE WORLD AND HITS ME,"
6055,"SOUTH POLE DISCOVERED, BABY! OHHHH! OH bleep AN ICE CAVE? bleep THINGS JUST KEEP ON GETTING BETTER, WOW, IT'S THE PLANET'S CORE,"
6066,"HEY, UH... I WAS GONNA HOPE OVER TO THE GLOPPYDROP SYSTEM, GET SOME ICE CREAM,"
6068,"I'LL BE OKAY, BYE, MORTY,"
6070,"YEAH, I AM, TO GET ICE CREAM,"
6072,"MORTY, IF YOU GO TO WHERE THERE'S A BUNCH OF ICE CREAM AND THEN YOU DON'T COME BACK, YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOTTEN ICE CREAM, YOU'VE JUST GONE WHERE ICE CREAM IS,"
6074,"WHERE'S THE VAN, MORTY?"
6079,"UH, HI, MY NAME IS JERRY SMITH, I'M FROM PLANET EARTH, I KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS OF RICK SANCHEZ, THE WANTED CRIMINAL,"
6083,"YEAH, HE KIDNAPPED ME AND MY FAMILY, AND HE LEFT US ON DWARF TERRACE-9, HE SAID HE WAS GONNA GO TO THE PLIMPLOM TAVERN, AND LISTEN,"
6085,"I'M DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE GALAXY BY CALLING YOU, SO IF WE COME BACK TO EARTH, CAN MY FAMILY HAVE A NORMAL LIFE?"
6109,"EVERYTHING,"
6119,"Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place."
6121,"Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's? "
6123,"Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home."
6125,"Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times."
6127,"Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect bleep didn't think I was worth your best equipment?"
6129,"Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain."
6131,Shoney's.
6134,Relaxed enough?  
6164,"Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel? "
6166,"' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?"
6168,"Yeah, well, tough titties."
6171,"Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty."
6175,The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
6177,"  Fine, but I'm driving."
6178,--as an excuse to strip away our freedom!
6195,To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
6197,"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory."
6199,"Okay. All right, all right."
6201,Me. I used to wear blue pants.
6206,"Well, well, well. If it isn't us. You know the worst part about inventing teleportation? Suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation. Fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful."
6227,"Imagine doing anything you want, then hopping to a timeline where you never did it. Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you."
6228,Sounds lonely.
6229,"Lonely? Dude, you have yourself -- your infinite selves. It's a nonstop party where all the guests are the only person we like. You think it's cool being the smartest man on Earth, but once we give you this technology, you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe -- the Infinite Rick, a god."
6230,"Eh, pass."
6231,"Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this. Who do you think you are?"
6232,"A different kind of Rick, I guess."
6233,"Well, we'll see how long that lasts."
6236,"Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off."
6238,"That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage."
6253,We detected a compromised portal gun. Where is your Rick?
6257,Very troubling. We can't risk Citadel secrets falling into the Federation's hands. We'll dispatch SEAL Team Ricks immediately to break into the prison holding C-137.
6259,Aand assassinate him.
6263,"Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt."
6269,Nooooooo!
6272,"Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I bleep got it."
6275,Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
6279,"Nope, they cannot."
6281,"Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer."
6283,"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story."
6286,"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out."
6288,"Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes."
6291,"Another day, another dollar. Am I right great insect creature or whaaat?!"
6293,Always wait for permission to buurp feel accomplishment. That's my motto.
6295,"Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug, but it's possible Rick knew he'd be interrogated at this facility, where we not only keep our most wanted, but our most sensitive data. Anyone here with level-nine access could buurp I don't know, collapse a government. I'm just gonna go take a dump. Is it cool if I use the level-nine bathroom? W-W-What's the level-nine master access code again?"
6297,Yeah! SEAL Team Rick's in the house! 
6301,"D-99, y-you okay?"
6303,I'm bummed I didn't get to give that insect dick a test-drive.
6304,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! T-The Council of Ricks sent us. We have your Morty and Summer. They're prisoners on the Citadel. "
6305,Great!
6308,"Lovely. Not only is my plan screwed up, I also forgot how to improvise."
6317,"Not anymore, homey. SEAL Team Ricks turned his unibrow into two brows -- with a bullet.   Your Rick's dead! Your Rick's dead! "
6319,"Sir, Rick D-99 is returning from the mission alone. Apparently, SEAL Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties."
6320,Bring him in.
6321,He says he'll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance.
6322,"La-di-da. Give me that. D-99, this is the commander in chief of the Citadel's militia."
6323,Gobuurp -- good enough.
6325,He's a spy. Blow him up. I'm gonna go take a shit.
6340,"Hey, whoa, whoa! What are you doing in here? This area's for teleporting the entire Citadel to somewhere else using only buttons and dials."
6341,"Yeah, well, it's a bad idea to have it designed that way then, isn't it?"
6344,What the bleep We just teleported into a galactic federal prison.
6345,I'm gonna go take a shit.
6349,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!"
6351,"The Citadel's been teleported to buurp Federation space. It's doomed. This has to be C-137, you guys. What are we gonna do?! You know he's coming for us."
6353,W-W-What the hell is that?
6354,Payback.
6358,Duh!
6361,"Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later."
6362,"Hold on, hold on. Whoa!"
6364,What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
6367,"I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer."
6371,"20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do."
6373,"Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death."
6375,"Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl."
6377,"Not an issue, sweetie."
6379,"Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really bleep this up right now."
6381,"I wasn't gonna let her die, you bleep moron!"
6384,The point is he thought I was going to.
6387,"You're a serious bleep idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand."
6395,"Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids."
6397,Oldest Rick trick in the book.
6401,Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
6403,"Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen."
6405,Destroying the buurp galactic government.
6409,"Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero."
6436,Guess who dismantled the government?
6438,"I never will, baby."
6440,"Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison."
6442,"No, you're right. Where's the vodka?"
6445,"Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage."
6447,"What the bleep Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle."
6450,"Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that."
6452,For everybody.
6458,"Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me."
6460,"Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty."
6462,"He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away."
6464,I've repbuurplaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home - 
6466,"- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -"
6468,"- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -"
6470,"- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -"
6472,"- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that ""Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -"
6474,"- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty."
6476,"That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce."
6478,"I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty."
6480,"If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty."
6482,"That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty."
6484,"Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce."
6486,"For 97 more years, Morty!"
6488,"I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!"
6504,"Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear? "
6506,"Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist."
6509,"Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody."
6512,"I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer."
6516,"Bitch, I was ready yest--"
6529,"Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!"
6531,"High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him! "
6537,"bleep! Get in the game, Morty!"
6540,"Holy shit, Summer for the win! "
6543,Here we go.
6545,Isotope 322. 
6554,"Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!"
6557,Whoa. That was cool.
6563,"Okay, getting darker."
6567,"Aw, come on."
6569,Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!
6571,Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?
6574,"All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there? "
6579,"Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!"
6584,Sounds good. Stay hydrated.
6587,"Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms."
6589,Uh...   bicep.
6593,"No. Okay, I'll level with you."
6595,"You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of."
6597,"Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--"
6599,"Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce."
6601,"No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp."
6603,"Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be..."
6607,"Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White."
6610,"The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here? "
6614,"Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here. "
6624,Ugh! Hey!
6627,"Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory."
6635,"Just stick and moo-buurp-oove, Morty! Wear him out!"
6664,"All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder? "
6669,"Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else."
6672,"Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids?"
6679,"Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy!"
6686,"Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever! "
6689,"All right, you know what? bleep it!"
6693,"Nope, regular blood."
6696,"Hi, sweetie."
6698,"Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic."
6702,"Not a mistake, no!"
6765,"Summer, state your deal."
6767,Morty? 
6769,All right.
6774,No problem.
6777,"Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right? "
6786,"Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't -- "
6788,"Well, try crying 15% less?"
6793,You do?! What the bleep is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.
6796,Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.
6823,"Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you."
6827,I want you and your sister to come home.
6829,"You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose."
6832,"I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty."
6835,"Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here."
6839,The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.
6846,"You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all."
6864,"Ah, Summer's home."
6880,"Uh, we should go to the garage."
6889,"Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society."
6892,"Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other."
6895,Coolsies.
6900,I enjoy this game.
6906,You know buurp it is buurp required.
6911,"Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks."
6914,"Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage."
6916,"What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, ""Downbeat""? No, thank you."
6950,  Morty.
6953,  Morty! 
6955,"  Hey, Mooorty!"
6962,"  Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!"
6964,Morty?
6966,"On my work bench, Morty."
6968,Flip the pickle over.
6970,"Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge."
6972,"I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal- I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! "
6974,"""And""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"
6976,"Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before - I'm a pickle. I'm Pickle Rick!"
6978,"I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner."
6980,I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
6982,"Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle."
6984,"The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't."
6987,"Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle! "
6989,Where are you guys going?
6991,"Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez."
6994,"It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact."
6996,"Morty, I assure you, I would never ""find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes."
6998,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go."
7001,"Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation."
7005,"W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie? "
7007,Can't argue with that.
7010,"Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it."
7012,"Okay, I may have bleeped up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  "
7014,"Oh, great. Stupid cat."
7016,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!"
7018,"Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
7020,"Oh, crap, that sun is bright."
7022,"Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet."
7024,So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
7026,"Oh, God, moisture."
7028,"Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!"
7030,Oh! Oh!
7032,"Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!"
7034,"Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh! "
7036,Come on. That's it.
7038,Come get this delicious brine.
7040,"Aah! Come on! Come on, motherbleep! Come on!"
7042,Yes!
7067,Wow. Ugh.
7069,"Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them."
7071,You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right.
7074,"Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh!"
7076,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb bleeping rat."
7078,"Oh, yeah! Aaaah!"
7098,"By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special."
7100,You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed.
7102,"God damn it, I love myself."
7104,Pickle Riiick!
7106,Get that parkour. Get that parkour!
7108,"Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit."
7110,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out."
7112,Whoa! Who in the bleep's toilet is this?
7132,"Hi, um, can you, uh buurp please let me out."
7137,You should know those men killed themselves.
7139,They didn't buurp let me out.
7142,"Uh, is this not a good time or...?"
7146,That'd be a lucky break for you.
7154,...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
7185,"Oh, come on!"
7189,You should know that isn't original.
7194,"Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit."
7197,"That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences."
7200,Jaguar couldn't make it.
7202,"No, thanks. I'm coming for you now."
7206,"Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you."
7208,"Huh, so you're a liar."
7210,I don't think so. See you soon.
7215,"Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live."
7217,"Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants."
7219,"Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh! "
7227,Ugh.
7230,Mm-hmm.
7232,"Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse? "
7235,Yes.
7237,So I wouldn't have to come here.
7239,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle When I feel like it. So you asked."
7242,"I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you."
7244,"Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever "
7246,"Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist."
7248,"Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now? "
7250,"Eh. Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man."
7252,"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach. We should get a drink."
7254,"Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on."
7258,"Yeah, either one. Either one."
7260,"You'll never get away with this, Concerto."
7262,"This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god."
7266,Jaguar! 
7268,"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy."
7272,"Alright Morty, you ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis? "
7275,"Oh, for bleep's sake. "
7276,  We're going from reality to reality asking Ricks to contribute to the Citadel of Ricks redevelopment fund. 
7277,"What are you, stupid? We're done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was buurp never on board with it in the first place, that's why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot. "
7282,You wanna rein in your Morty? 
7283,  Every day. 
7285,  Let's go. 
7287,You don't have to be a dick. 
7288,I think you know that's not true. 
7291,  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas. 
7311,Citadel Morning News: News about the Citadel in the morning. Pretty self explanatory. 
7314,Good morning. I'm Rick D716-B. 
7315,And I'm Rick D716. 
7316,Must be nice. 
7317,Coming up! Gravity outages in East Sanchez Heights! 
7318,"And, is your uranium-powered cellular matrix making you sick? The answer may not surprise you. It's 'yes, it's uranium.' "
7319,Those stories and more after this break. 
7334,Just one day remains before our newly democratic Citadel elects its first president. It's anyone's race among the Rick candidates. 
7336,But a certain other candidate should be getting at least one vote for most adorable. 
7338,"That's right, the Morty Party candidate's still in the race, and you just gotta love him for that. "
7340,"Here you see him in his little Morty suit, waving. Isn't that adorable? Little jackass. "
7342,"Uh, yeah, I think we actually have the audio for his speech here. ""Aw geez, aw man, I'm gonna lose the election and stuff."" "
7354,"Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting-- "
7361,"That's pretty harsh, sir. "
7363,"Look, I'm just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys ""animals"". "
7365,"Well, I'm glad to know there's more like me. "
7370,Fifth and buurp? That's Mortytown. 
7374,"Good idea, Rick. "
7377,This is a great adventure. 
7379,I love being your new Morty. 
7383,"Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.   Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had? "
7385,"I see. So you are top of the class in something.   Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty? "
7387,"Anything's possible, Tall Morty. Ugh... "
7402,"  affectionately known as ""Cool Rick."" "
7404,"I know I'm new to the Citadel and some of you might not think I've put in my time, but what can I say? I'm Cool Rick!   Yo, ha-ha-ha, check me out! "
7405,"Alright, knuckle-buurp-heads, any questions?   Alright then, back to work, you gold-Rickers. "
7414,"Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut? "
7433,Do you realize how many codes you just violated? 
7437,More lasers. 
7438,"You can take more time to answer the question if you'd like.   ...Okay, Juggling Rick. How would you solve the Citadel's financial crisis? "
7439,"First off, can I just say that I think this Citadel is the greatest in the entire multiverse. Now, I believe the answer to your question has three parts.   "
7442,But it has to be balanced with defense!   Whoa! 
7446,"Candidate Morty. The number of displaced Mortys is soaring, while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider.   Solve that one real quick. "
7449,"Oh, shocker.   "
7450,I'd like to offer a rebuttal.   
7451,"Gentlemen, gentlemen! I think we can all agree on one thing.   Well, came out as two things, but you get the idea. "
7461,Holy shit. 
7469,"Sounds like you're looking for work. I can offer you a very enticing compensation package.   First, let's talk benefits. "
7472,  Daddy loves you... That's Daddy's good girl. 
7473,  All your lives are lies! Don't you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks but they stripped us of anything that made us unique! 
7474,"  We know how you feel. We're working stiff Ricks just like you, but our assembly line is justice. What are your demands? "
7475,"buurp I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison! "
7476,The media's outside. 
7477,Well keep 'em there! 
7480,"Anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the Citadel is a lie built on lies and some other shit.   I say, appreciate the life you have, because it can always be worse. Back to you, Ricks. "
7481,"Thank you, Rick 716-C.   That bleepin' guy. "
7482,Tell me about it. 
7484,"Ahem. Meanwhile in election news, an unexpected turn of events as Morty from the Morty Party soars to the top of the polls. "
7488,Morty! What's your original reality and where's your Rick? 
7498,It's not faith you need. It's fear. 
7501,  Look at how I'm dressed. 
7502,"Taking on the system like this, are you afraid at all for your safety? "
7510,"Shit, grandson, you keep me peelin' squap-squams and slippin' nib-nibs I'll lick whatever ain't nailed down. "
7512,Hands in the air! 
7517,Is this what I think it is? 
7524,"It's okay, Morty. "
7527,"He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty. "
7529,You were right...   Everything I learned in the academy was-- 
7531,Why is there a crib in here? 
7534,"Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh? "
7537,What happened?
